# SpringHibernateTestApp
Tech used:

1. SpringMVC (Server side)
2. Hbernate 5 (ORM)
3. AngularJS 1.5 (Client side)
4. JQuery
5. MySql (Database)
6. Bootstrap for styling
7. Maven

This is Note taking app using spring mvc using fully Java Config as well as xml based configuration using hibernate 5. Do let me know of any issues in comment or file a bug in bug section or feel free to email me directly. 

# Deployment:
It's a maven based SpringMVC project with Hibernate as it's ORM tool.
To deploy you need to have maven isntalled.
MySql isused for database, get that installed too.
Using appropriate username and password, login to mysql db and create a database manually. It shall hold all data of notes.

Once done, make a build of the code using 'mvn clean install' command on terminal in Mac or Linux, or cmd in Windows.

Once the build is successfully created, rename it to spring-hibernate-example and deploy in server. I use my favourite Tomcat.
Start the server and hit the URL 'http://localhost:8080/spring-hibernate-example/'.

Up and running? 
If Yes, Happy learning!
If No, Do let me know.
